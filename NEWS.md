# patRoon 0.1.0.9000

## Decomber 2018
* `file` argument for `clearCache()`
* Updates on MS peak lists
    * More consistent naming for algorithm specific MS peak list generators (i.e. `generateMSPeakListsX` where X is the algo).
    * Additional MS peak lists are generated by averaging the lists of features within a feature group.
    * `generateCompounds()` and plotting functionality now uses averaged group peak lists instead of peak list of most intense analysis.
    * `plotSpec()` method for MSPeakLists: plot (non-annotated) MS and MS/MS spectra.


## November 2018
* Default value for `maxRtMSWidth` argument used for peak list generation.
* Fixed: `maxRtMSWidth` argument for mzR peak list generation had no effect.
* Preliminary EPA DSSTox support (via LocalCSV).
* Added `addAllDAEICs()` function.
* Renamed `mzWidth` argument of `addDAEIC()` to `mzWindow`.
* Normalization of compound scores: normalization method can now be set and specified scorings can be excluded.
* Store/report IUPACName (as compoundName) from MetFrag PubChem data.
* Renamed trivialName to compoundName for compound tables.
* `convertMSFiles`: changed interface with more options, parallelization and ProteoWizard support.
* Automatic optimization of parameters necessary for feature finding and grouping. Heavily based on the IPO R package. See the 'feature-optimization' manual page.
* **IMPORTANT** `getXcmsSet()` is renamed to `getXCMSSet()`
* verbose option for `findFeatures()` / `groupFeatures()`
* Changed `nintersects` default for plotUpSet so that all intersections are plotted by default.
* plotChord() now properly stops if nothing overlaps.
* replicateGroupSubtract() now removes replicate groups that were subtracted.
* Fixed: replicateGroupSubtract() now correctly takes maximum mean intensity for threshold determination when multiple rGroups are specified.
* Fixed: Wrong compound clusters plotted in reportMD().
* Fixed: Added timeout after restarting failed command (e.g. MetFrag CL) to prevent rare error "The requested operation cannot be performed on a file with a user-mapped section open".


## October 2018
* OpenMS `features` class objects now store number of isotopes found for each feature.
* **IMPORTANT** Added all relevant options of FeatureFinderMetabo as function arguments to findFeaturesOpenMS() and renamed/reordered current options for more conistent style. Please check ?findFeatures for the updated function arguments!
* openReport option for reportMD(). If TRUE the generated report will be opened with a web browser.
* reportPlots option for reportMD() which collapses reportFGroups, reportChord and reportFormulaSpectra and adds control to plot Venn and UpSet diagrams.
* plotUpSet() methods to compare feature groups by UpSet plots. See e.g. http://caleydo.org/tools/upset/
* filter() method for features.
* EICs now loaded via faster C++ code thats uses mzR instead of XCMS
* Moved feature intensity loading code for OpenMS features to C++. This results in much faster feature finding.


## September 2018
* Removed filterBy methods: these are now deprecated with new subset operators and groupNames()/analyses() methods. Example: `fGroups <- fGroups[, groupNames(compounds)]`
* subset/extraction operators ("[", "[[" and "$") for features, featureGroups, MSPeakLists, formulas, formulaConsensus, compounds, compoundsCluster and components classes.
* analyses() and groupNames() generics to get analyses and feature group names of the data within an object.
* "[" method for featureGroups: empty feature groups now always dropped, drop argument now ignored.
* reportMD(): The layout to show compounds, formulas and components is now done with DataTables (DT package). This change allows faster initial loading of results. Furthermore, several small tweaks were done to improve general design.
* plotSpec() (compounds method): remove unused normalizeScores flag
* plotSpec() (compounds method): plotting of embedded structure now optional (plotStruct argument)
* plotSpec() (compounds method): automatic calculation of necessary extra height to plot labels/structure


## Augustus 2018
* The XML code required to load feature (group) data generated by OpenMS is now moved to a C++ interface that uses [Rcpp] and [pugixml]. This results in a significant reduction of required processing time. In addition, files are now processed in chunks, allowing even very large feature sets (>10000) without clogging up system memory.
* Improved general numeric comparisons, resulting in e.g. improved EIC generation.
* Tweaked OpenMS feature intensity loading: now takes intensity from data point closest to retention time instead of max intensity from datapoints in the search window. Furthermore, the search window for datapoints was reduced and made configurable.


## July 2018
* getMCS() method for compounds
* plotStructure() method for compounds will draw MCS when mutiple indices are specified


## June 2018
* Added removeRefAnalyses argument to filter() (featureGroups method) to easily remove e.g. analyses that are used as blanks after blank subtraction.
* Added filterBy() method which removes any feature groups from a featureGroups object of which no results are present in a specified object. Methods are defined for MSPeakLists, formulaConsenus, compounds and components. This method replaces some of the functionality of the filter() method for featureGroups (formConsensus and compounds arguments).
* Added mz and chromatographic peak width range options to filter() method for feature groups.
* Moved intensity clustering code (makeHCluster) to new component type (see componentsIntClust class documentation).


## May 2018
* Added compound clustering (see makeHCluster method for compounds). This is an useful tool to get an overview of all the candidate chemical structures after compound identification. The clustering will reduce data complexity. Furthermore, maximum common sucstructures (MCS) can be calculated and plotted for each cluster to get a quick impression of the different structures of candidates.
* Added function arguments checks using [checkmate]. This guards all exported functions and methods from wrong user input arguments. If any problems are found (e.g. a wrong data type or range was specified) then the user is informed about this and what kind of input is to be expected.
* Added workaround (removed latex dependencies added automatically by `kableExtra` package) that may cause memory leakage when `reportMD()` is called repeatedly.


## April 2018
* Added unit tests (using [testthat]) and fixed several small bugs that were revealed in the process.
* Continuous integration (CI) with running tests on [CircleCI] (Linux builds) and [AppVeyor] (Windows builds) and testing coverage on [Codecov]. Docker images with patRoon and all its dependencies are automatically pushed on [Docker Hub][DH].
* Many small bug fixes.
