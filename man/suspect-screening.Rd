\arguments{
\item{obj}{The object that should be screened (\emph{i.e.}
\code{\link{features}} or \code{\link{featureGroups}}).}

\item{suspects}{A \code{data.frame} that must consist a \code{"name"} column
(the analyte name) and \emph{either} a \code{"mz"}, \code{"neutralMass"},
\code{"SMILES"}, \code{"InChI"} or \code{"formula"} column (with the
ionized m/z value, the neutral monoisotopic mass or the
SMILES/InChI/chemical formula character string for the molecule,
respectively). When no \code{"mz"} is specified the adduct must be
specified either with the \code{adduct} function argument or by an
\code{"adduct"} column containing a \code{character} that can be converted
with \code{as.adduct} (\emph{e.g.} \code{"[M+H]+"}).  In addition, a column
\code{"rt"} can be included to specify the retention time (if unspecified
no retention times are checked).}

\item{rtWindow, mzWindow}{The retention time window (in seconds) and
\emph{m/z} window that will be used for matching a suspect (+/- feature
data).}

\item{adduct}{An \code{\link{adduct}} object (or something that can be
converted to it with \code{\link{as.adduct}}). Examples: \code{"[M-H]-"},
\code{"[M+Na]+"}. Can be \code{NULL} if either a \code{"mz"} or
\code{"adduct"} column is present in the \code{suspects} argument.}

\item{fGroups}{The \code{\link{featureGroups}} object that should be
transformed (and was used to obtain the screening results).}

\item{scr}{The screening results table returned by \code{screenSuspects}.}

\item{path}{The file path to an Excel export of the Global results table from
TASQ, converted to \file{.csv} format.}

\item{analysisInfo}{A table with \link[=analysis-information]{analysis
information}.}
}
\value{
\code{screenSuspects} will return a table (a
  \code{\link{data.table}}) with detected suspects and details such as
  retention and \emph{m/z} values. If a suspect is matched on multiple
  features/feature groups then each hit is reported as a separate row.

\code{groupFeaturesScreening} returns a modified \code{featureGroups}
  object in which those feature groups that were not matched by any suspects
  are removed and others renamed by the respective suspect name. In case of
  duplicate suspect results, feature group names are made unique with
  \code{\link{make.unique}}.

\code{importFeatureGroupsBrukerTASQ} returns a new
  \code{featureGroups} object containing converted screening results from
  Bruker TASQ.

\description{
Utilities to screen for analytes with known or suspected identity.
}
\details{
Besides 'full non-target analysis', where compounds may be identitified with
little to no prior knowledge, a common strategy is to screen for compounds
with known or suspected identity. This may be a generally favourable approach
if possible, as it can significantly reduce the load on data interpretation.

\code{screenSuspects} will screen a set of suspects (provided as a
  \code{data.frame}) within an \code{\link{features}} or
  \code{\link{featureGroups}} object.

\code{groupFeaturesScreening} uses results from \code{screenSuspects}
  to transform an existing \code{\link{featureGroups}} object by (1) renaming
  any matched feature groups by the respective name of the suspect and (2)
  filtering out any feature groups that were not matched. A common workflow
  is to first obtain and group features (with \emph{e.g.}
  \code{\link{findFeatures}} and \code{\link{groupFeatures}}), screen them
  with \code{screenSuspects}, convert the \code{featureGroups} object that was
  used for screening with this method function and continue any further
  workflow steps such as compound identification as with 'regular'
  \code{featureGroups}.

\code{importFeatureGroupsBrukerTASQ} will convert screening results
  from Bruker TASQ to a \code{\link{featureGroups}} object. Groups are made
  based on target analyte names and individual results per analysis are used
  to generate the features. The input for this function is obtained by
  generating an Excel export of the 'global' results and subsequently
  converting the file to \file{.csv} format. Similar to
  \code{groupFeaturesScreening}, this method will return an object that is
  suitable for any further workflow processes.
}
\note{
Both \code{groupFeaturesScreening} and
  \code{importFeatureGroupsBrukerTASQ} use names from targets/suspects as
  feature group names, therefore, it is important that these are
  file-compatible names when \link[=reporting]{reporting data}.

Please note that \code{groupFeaturesScreening} method can only
  transform the \code{featureGroups} object that was used to obtain the given
  screening results.

\code{importFeatureGroupsBrukerTASQ} will use estimated min/max values
  for retention times and dummy min/max \emph{m/z} values for conversion to
  features, since this information is not (readily) available. Hence, when
  plotting, for instance, extracted ion chromatograms (with
  \code{\link{plotEIC}}) the integrated chromatographic peak range shown is
  incorrect.
