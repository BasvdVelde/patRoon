In a non-target workflow both chromatographic and mass spectral data is automatically processed in order to provide a comprehensive chemical characterization of your samples. While the exact workflow is typically dependent on the type of study, it generally involves of the following steps:

```{r workflow,echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [ rankdir = LR, compound = true ]
  node [ shape = box,
         fixedsize = true,
         width = 2.6,
         height = 1,
         fontsize = 20,
         fillcolor = darkseagreen1,
         style = filled ]

  subgraph cluster1 {
    color=blue;

    'Find features' -> 'Group features'
    'Group features' -> 'MS peak lists'
  }

  'Formula annotation' -> Reporting [ltail=cluster3, lhead=cluster4]
}", height = 250, width = 750)
```


<!-- UNDONE: optional lines (scheme/text below) -->

Note that `patRoon` supports flexible composition of workflows. In the scheme above you can recognize optional steps by a _XXX line/arrow_. Furthermore, the inclusion of each step is only necessary if a further steps depends on its data. For instance, annotation and componentization do not depend on each other and can therefore be executed in any different order or simply be omitted. A brief descripton of all steps is given below. 

During **data pre-treatment** raw MS data is prepared for further analysis. A common need for this step is to convert the data to an open format so that other tools are able to process it. Other pre-treatment steps may involve re-calibration of _m/z_ data or performing advanced filtering operations.

The next step is to extract **features** from the data. While different terminologies are used, a feature in `patRoon` refers to a single chromatographic peak in an extracted ion chromatogram for a single _m/z_ value (within a defined tolerance). Hence, a feature contains both chromatographic data (e.g. retention time and peak height) and mass spectral data (e.g. the accurate _m/z_). Note that with mass spectrometry multiple _m/z_ values may be detected for a single compound as a result of adduct formation, natural isotopes and/or in-source fragments. Some algorithms may try to combine these different masses in a single feature. However, in `patRoon` we generally assume this is not the case (and may optionally be done afterwards during the componentization step described below). Features are sometimes simply referred to as 'peaks'.

Features are found per analysis. Hence, in order to compare a feature across analyses, the next step is to group them. This step is essential as it finds equal features even if their retention time or _m/z_ values slightly differ due to analytical variability. The resulting **feature groups** are crucial input for subsequent workflow steps. Prior to grouping, _retention time alignment_ between analyses may be performed to improve grouping of features, especially when processing multiple analysis batches at once. Outside `patRoon` feature groups may also be defined as _profiles_, _aligned_ or _grouped features_ or _buckets_.

Depending on the study type, **suspect screening** is then performed to limit the features that should be considered for further processing. As its name suggests, with suspect screening only those features which are suspected to be present are considered for further processing. These suspects are retrieved from a suspect list which contains the _m/z_ and (optionally) retention times for each suspect. Typical suspect lists may be composed from databases with known pollutants or from predicted transformation products. Note that for a 'full' non-target analysis no suspect screening is performed, hence, this step is simply omitted and all features are to be considered.

After features have been collected the next step typically involves **annotation**. During this step MS and MS/MS data are collected in so called **MS peak lists**, which are then used as input for formula and compound annotation. Formula annotation involves automatic calculation of possible formulae for each feature based on its _m/z_, isotopic pattern and MS/MS fragments, whereas compound annotation (or identification) involves the assignment of actual chemical structures to each feature. Note that during formula and compound annotation typically multiple candidates are assigned to a single feature. To assist interpretation of this data each candidate is therefore ranked on characteristics such as isotopic fit, number of explained MS/MS fragments and metadata from an online database such as number of scientific references or presence in common suspect lists.

Besides annotation, another step to perform after extraction of features is **componentization**. A **component** is defined as a collection of multiple feature groups that are somehow related to each other. Typical exmples are features that belong to the same chemical compound (i.e. with different _m/z_ values but equal retention time), such as adducts, isotopes and in-source fragments. Other examples are homologues series and features that display a similar intensity trend across samples.

The final step of the workflow is to **report** the data. During this step all data from the workflow is reported graphically or in a text file format suitable to be loaded by other tools. Interactive reports can also be made which typically greatly improve data interpretation.

To summarize:

* **Data-pretreatment** involves preparing raw MS data for further processing (e.g. conversion to an open format)
* **Features** describe chromatographic and _m/z_ information (or 'peaks') in all analyses.
* A **feature group** consists of equal features across analyses.
* With **suspect screening** only features that are considered to be on a suspect list are considered further in the workflow.
* **MS peak lists** Summarizes all MS and MS/MS data that will be used for subsequent annotation.
* During **formula** and **compound annotation** candidate formulae/structures will be assigned and ranked for each feature.
* **Componentization** involves consolidating different feature groups that have a relationship to each other in to a single component.
* **Reporting** is performed as the final step to assist interpretation of the data generated during the workflow.

## Generating workflow data

Each step in the non-target workflow is performed by a function that perform the heavy lifting of a workflow step behind the scenes and finally return the results. An important goal of `patRoon` is to support multiple algorithms for each workflow step, hence, when such a function is called you have to specify which algorithm you want to use. The available algorithms and their characteristics will be discussed in the next sections. An overview of all functions involved in generating workflow data is shown in the table below.

Workflow step         | Function                                          | Output S4 class
--------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------
Data pre-treatment    | `convertMSFiles()`, `recalibrarateDAFiles()`      | -
Finding features      | `findFeatures()`                                  | `features`
Grouping features     | `groupFeatures()`                                 | `featureGroups`
Suspect screening     | `screenTargets()` + `groupFeaturesScreening()`    | `featureGroups` 
MS peak lists         | `generateMSPeakLists()`                           | `MSPeakLists`
Formula annotation    | `generateFormulas()`                              | `formulas`
Compound annotation   | `generateCompounds()`                             | `compounds`
Componentization      | `generateComponents()`                            | `components`

All of these functions store their output in objects derived from so called S4 classes. Knowing the details about the S4 class system of `R` is generally not important when using `patRoon` (and well written resources are available if you want to know more). In brief, usage of this class system allows a general data format that is used irrespective of the algorithm that was used to generate the data. For instance, when features have been found by [OpenMS] or [XCMS] they both return the same data format.

Another advantage of the S4 class system is the usage of so called _generic functions_. To put simply: a generic function performs a certain task for different types of data objects. A good example is the `plotSpec()` function which plots an (annotated) spectrum from data of MS peak lists or from formula or compound annotation:

```{r plotSpec,eval=FALSE}
plotSpec(mslists, ...) # plot raw MS spectrum
plotSpec(formulas, ...) # plot annotated spectrum from formula annotation data
plotSpec(compounds, ...) # likewise but for compound annotation.
```

The next sections will further detail on how to actually perform the non-target workflow steps and use their output.

## Preparing the workflow

### Data pre-treatment

Prior to performing the actual non-target data processing workflow some preparations often need to be made. Often data has to be pre-treated, for instance, by converting it to an open format that is usable for subsequent workflow steps or to perform mass re-calibration. Some common functions are listed below.

Task                                |  Function                | Algorithms | Supported file formats
------------------------------------| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------
Conversion                          | `convertMSFiles()`       | [OpenMS], [ProteoWizard], DataAnalysis | All common (algorithm dependent)
Advanced (e.g. spectral filtering)  | `convertMSFiles()`       | [ProteoWizard]                         | All common
Mass re-calibration                 | `recalibrarateDAFiles()` | DataAnalysis                           | Bruker

The `convertMSFiles()` function supports conversion between many different file formats typically used in non-target analysis. Furthermore, other pre-treatment steps are available (e.g. centroiding, filtering) when the [ProteoWizard] algorithm is used. For an overview of these functionalities see the [MsConvert documentation]. Some examples:

```{r convert,eval=FALSE}
# Converts a single mzXML file to mzML format
convertMSFiles("standard-1.mzXML", to = "mzML", algorithm = "openms")

# Converts all Thermo files with ProteoWizard (the default) in the analyses/raw
# directory and stores the mzML files in analyses/raw. Afterwards, only MS1
# spectra are retained.
convertMSFiles("analyses/raw", "analyses/mzml", from = "thermo",
               centroid = "vendor", filters = "msLevel 1")
```

> **_NOTE_** Most algorithms require the _mzML_ or _mzXML_ file format and additionally require that mass peaks have been centroided. When using the ProteoWizard algorithm (the default), centroiding by vendor algorithms is generally recommended (i.e. by setting `centroid="vendor"` as shown in the above example).

When Bruker MS data is used it can be automatically re-calibrated to improve its mass accuracy. Often this is preceeded by calling the `setDAMethod()` function to set a DataAnalysis method to all files in order to configure automatic re-calibration. The `recalibrarateDAFiles()` function performs the actual re-calibration. The `getDACalibrationError()` function can be used at anytime to request the current calibration error of each analysis. An example of these functions is shown below.

```{r brukerCalib,eval=FALSE}
# anaInfo is a data.frame with information on analyses (see next section)
setDAMethod(anaInfo, "path/to/DAMethod.m") # configure Bruker files with given method that has automatic calibration setup
recalibrarateDAFiles(anaInfo) # trigger re-calibration for each analysis
getDACalibrationError(anaInfo) # get calibration error for each analysis (NOTE: also shown when previous function is finished)
```

### Analysis information

The final bits of preparation is constructing the information for the analyses that need to be processed. In `patRoon` this is referred to as the _analysis information_ and often stored in a variable `anaInfo` (of course you are free to choose a different name!). The analysis information should be a `data.frame` with the following columns:

* **path**: the directory path of the file containing the analysis data
* **analysis**: the name of the analysis. This should be the file name _without_ file extension.
* **group**: to which _replicate group_ the analysis belongs. All analysis which are replicates of each other get the same name.
* **ref**: which replicate group should be used for blank subtraction.
* **conc** (optional, advanced) A numeric value describing the concentration or any other value for which the intensity in this sample may correlate, for instance, dilution factor, sampling time etc. This column is only required when using the `regression()` function (see `?regression` for more information).

<!-- UNDONE: tutorial link? -->

The `generateAnalysisInfo()` function can be used to (semi-)automatically generate a suitable `data.frame` that contains all the required information for a set of analysis. For, instance, the following line was used in the tutorial:

```{r genAnaInfo,eval=FALSE}
# Take example data from patRoonData package (triplicate solvent blank + triplicate standard)
anaInfo <- generateAnalysisInfo(paths = patRoonData::exampleDataPath(),
                                groups = c(rep("solvent", 3), rep("standard", 3)),
                                refs = "solvent")
```

Alternatively, the `newProject()` function discussed in the next section can be used to interactively construct this information.

### Automatic project generation with newProject()

The previous sections already highlighted some steps that have to be performed prior to starting a new non-target analysis workflow: data pre-treatment and gathering information on the analysis. Most of the times you will put this and other `R` code a script file so you can re-call what you have done before (i.e. reproducbile research).

The `newProject()` function can be used to setup a new project. When you run this function it will launch a small tool (see screenshot below) where you can select your analyses and configure the various workflow steps which you want to execute (e.g. data pre-treatment, finding features, annotation etc). After setting everything up the function will generate a template script which can easily be edited afterwards. In addition, you have the option to create a new RStudio project, which is advantegeous as it neatly seperates your data processing work from the rest.

> **_NOTE_** At the moment `newProject()` _only_ works with (recent) versions of RStudio.


## Features

<!-- UNDONE: enviMass? -->

Collecting features from the analyses consists of finding all features, grouping them across analyses (optionally after retention time alignment) and finally, if desired suspect screening: 

```{r featWorkflow,echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [ rankdir = LR, compound = true ]
  node [ shape = box,
         fixedsize = true,
         width = 2.2,
         height = 1,
         fontsize = 18,
         fillcolor = darkseagreen1,
         style = filled ]

    'Find features' -> 'Group features'
    'Suspect screening'  [shape=ellipse, fillcolor = lightcyan]
    'Group features' -> 'Suspect screening' [dir=both]
}", height = 100, width = 500)
```

### Finding and grouping features

Several algorithms are available for finding features. These are listed in the table below alongside their usage and general remarks.

Algorithm       | Usage                                     | Remarks
--------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------
[OpenMS]        | `findFeatures(algorithm = "openms", ...)` | Uses the [FeatureFinderMetabo] algorithm
[XCMS]          | `findFeatures(algorithm = "xcms", ...)`   | Uses `xcms::xcmsSet()` function
[XCMS] (import) | `importFeatures(algorithm = "xcms")`      | Imports an existing `xcmsSet` object.
[enviPick]      | `findFeatures(algorithm = "envipick")`    | Uses `enviPick::enviPickwrap()`
DataAnalysis    | `findFeatures(algorithm = "bruker")`      | Uses Find Molecular Features from DataAnalysis (Bruker only)

<!-- UNDONE: link to fOpt? -->

In our experience the performance of these algorithms heavily depend on the data and parameter settings that are used. Since obtaining a good feature dataset is crucial for the rest of the workflow, it is highly recommended to experiment with different settings. Some common parameters to look at are listed in the table below. However, there are many more (advanced) parameters that can be set, please see the reference documentation for these (e.g. `?findFeatures`).

Algorithm      | Common parameters
-------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OpenMS]       | `noiseThrInt`, `chromSNR`, `chromFWHM`, `mzPPM`, `minFWHM`, `maxFWHM` (see `?findFeatures`)
[XCMS]         | `min_peakwidth`, `mzdiff`, `prefilter`, `noise` (assuming default `centWave` algorithm, see `?findPeaks.centWave`)
[enviPick]     | `dmzgap`, `dmzdens`, `drtgap`, `drtsmall`, `drtdens`, `drtfill`, `drttotal`, `minpeak`, `minint`, `maxint` (see `?enviPickwrap`)
DataAnalysis   | See _Find_ -> _Parameteres..._ -> _Molecular Features_ in DataAnalysis.

> **_NOTE_** DataAnalysis feature settings have to be configured in DataAnalysis prior to calling `findFeatures()`.

Similarly, for grouping features across analyses several algorithms are supported.

Algorithm | Usage | Remarks
--------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------
[OpenMS] | `groupFeatures(algorithm = "openms", ...)` | Uses the [FeatureFinderMetabo] algorithm
[XCMS] | `groupFeatures(algorithm = "xcms", ...)` | Uses `xcms::group()` function
ProfileAnalysis | `importFeatureGroups(algorithm = "brukerpa", ...)` | Import `.csv` file exported from Bruker ProfileAnalysis
TASQ | `importFeatureGroups(algorithm = "brukertasq", ...)` | Imports a _Global result table_ (exported to Excel file and then saved as `.csv` file)

Just like finding features, each algorithm has their own set of parameters. Often the defaults are a good start but it is recommended to have look at them. See `?groupFeatures` for more details.

Some examples of finding and grouping features are shown below.

<!-- UNDONE: enable this for testing? -->

```{r feat,eval=FALSE}
# The anaInfo variable contains analysis information, see the previous section

# Finding features
fListOMS <- findFeatures(anaInfo, "openms") # OpenMS, with default settings
fListOMS2 <- findFeatures(anaInfo, "openms", noiseThrInt = 500, chromSNR = 10) # OpenMS, adjusted minimum intensity and S/N
fListXCMS <- findFeatures(anaInfo, "xcms", min_peakwidth = 10) # XCMS
fListXCMS2 <- importFeatures(anaInfo, "xcms", xset) # import XCMS xcmsSet object
fListEP <- findFeatures(anaInfo, "envipick", minint = 1E3) # enviPick

# Grouping features
fGroupsOMS <- groupFeatures(fListOMS, "openms") # OpenMS grouping, default settings
fGroupsOMS2 <- groupFeatures(fListOMS2, "openms", rtalign = FALSE) # OpenMS grouping, no RT alignment
fGroupsOMS3 <- groupFeatures(fListXCMS, "openms", maxGroupRT = 6) # group XCMS features with OpenMS, adjusted grouping parameter
fGroupsXCMS <- groupFeatures(fListEP, "xcms", minfrac = 0) # group enviPick features with XCMS, disable minfrac
```

### Suspect screening

After features have been grouped suspect screening may be performed to eliminate any feature groups with _m/z_ and (optionally) retention properties not present in a given suspect list. A typical workflow looks like this:

```{r susp,eval=FALSE}
targets <- data.frame(name = c("susp1", "susp2", "susp3"),
                      mz = c(100.1034, 250.0456, 300.1234),
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
scr <- screenTargets(fGroups, targets)
fGroupsSusp <- groupFeaturesScreening(fGroups, scr)
```

<!-- UNDONE: make this interactive -->

This will perform the following steps:

1. Create a suspect list. A suspect list is a `data.frame` with mandatory `name` and `mz` columns. Optionally, it may also contain an `rt` column for retention times (in seconds). In reality loading such a table is easiest from a _.csv_ file with e.g. `read.csv()`.
2. Screen a feature groups object for the suspects. The return value will be a `data.frame` with results.
3. Use the screening results to filter the original feature groups and store the results in `fGroupsSusp`.

- Table with algorithms and remarks about their selection
- Process: extract features --> align RT --> group (--> suspect screening)

## Annotation

The annotation consists of collecting MS peak lists and then formula and/or compound annotation:

```{r annWorkflow,echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [ rankdir = LR ]
  node [ shape = box,
         fixedsize = true,
         width = 2.3,
         height = 1,
         fontsize = 18,
         fillcolor = darkseagreen1,
         style = filled ]

    'MS peak lists' -> 'Formula annotation'
    'MS peak lists' -> 'Compound annotation'
    'Formula annotation':e -> 'Compound annotation':e [style = dotted, constraint = false]
}", height = 160, width = 500)
```

Note that compound annotation is normally not dependent upon formula annotation. However, formula data can be used to improve ranking of candidates afterwards by the `addFormulaScoring()` function, which will be discussed later in this section.

### Adducts

- Adducts: conversion --> Move to advanced? Also because components are a bit involved.

### MS peak lists

Algorithm    | Usage                                            | Remarks
------------ | ---------------------------------------------    | -----------------------------------------------------
[mzR]        | `generateMSPeakLists(algorithm = "mzr", ...)`    | Uses [mzR] for spectra retrieval. Recommended default.
DataAnalysis | `generateMSPeakLists(algorithm = "bruker", ...)` | Loads data after automatically generating MS and MS/MS spectra in DataAnalysis
DataAnalysis FMF | `generateMSPeakLists(algorithm = "brukerfmf", ...)` | Uses spectra from the  _find molecular features_ algorithm.

The recommended default algorithm is `mzr`: this algorithm is generally faster and is not limited to a vendor data format as it will read the open `mzML` and `mzXML` file formats. On the other hand, when DataAnalysis is used with Bruker data the spectra can be automatically background subtracted and there is no need for file conversion. Note that the `brukerfmf` algorithm only works when `findFeatures()` was called with the `bruker` algorithm.

<!-- UNDONE: Add images here? -->

When `generateMSPeakists()` is called it will

1. Find all MS and MS/MS spectra that 'belong' to a feature. For MS spectra this means that all spectra close to the retention time of a feature will be collected. In addition, for MS/MS normally only spectra will be considered that have a precursor mass close to that of the feature (however, this can be disabled for data that was recorded with data independent acquisition (DIA, MS^E, bbCID, ...)).
2. Average all MS and MS/MS spectra to produce peak lists for each feature.
3. Average all peak lists for features within the same group.

Formula calculation uses either data from (2) or (3) (i.e. trade-off between accuracy and speed), whereas compound annotation will always use data from (3) to limit required resources and processing time.

There are several common function arguments to `generateMSPeakLists()` that can be used to optimize its behaviour:

<!-- UNDONE: add topMost for Bruker when it's there -->

Argument | Algorithm(s) | Remarks
-------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
maxMSRtWindow | `mzr`, `bruker` | Maximum time window +/- the feature retention time (in seconds) to collect spectra for averaging. Higher values may significantly increase processing times.
precursorMzWindow | 'mzr' | Maximum precursor _m/z_ search window to find MS/MS spectra. Set to `NULL` to disable (i.e. for DIA experiments).
topMost | `mzr` | Only retain feature data for no more than this amount analyses with highest intensity. For instance, a value of _1_ will only keep peak lists for the feature with highest intensity in a feature group.  
bgsubtr | `bruker` | Perform background subtraction (if the spectra type supports this, e.g. MS and bbCID)
minMSIntensity, minMSMSIntensity | `bruker`, `brukerfmf` | Minimum MS and MS/MS intensity. Note that DataAnalysis reports many zero intensity peaks so a value of at least _1_ is recommended.
MSMSType | `bruker` | The type of spectra that should be used for MSMS: `"BBCID"` for bbCID experiments, otherwise `"MSMS"` (the default).

In addition, several parameters can be set that affect spectral averaging. These parameters are passed as a `list` to the `avgFeatParams` (`mzr` algorithm only) and `avgFGroupParams` arguments, which affect averaging of feature and feature group data, respectively. Some typical parameters include:

* `clusterMzWindow`: Maximum _m/z_ window used to cluster mass peaks when averaging. The better the MS resolution, the lower this value should be.
* `topMost`: Retain no more than this amount of most intense mass peaks. Useful to filter out 'noisy' peaks.
* `minIntensityPre` / `minIntensityPost`: Mass peaks below this intensity will be removed before/after averaging.

See `?generateMSPeakLists` for all possible parameters.

A suitable list object to set averaging parameters can be obtained with the `getDefAvgPListParams()` function.

```{r avgMSPLParamas,eval=FALSE}
# lower default clustering window, other settings remain default
avgPListParams <- getDefAvgPListParams(clusterMzWindow = 0.001)

# Apply to both feature and feature group averaging
plists <- generateMSPeakLists(fGroups, "mzr", avgFeatParams = avgPListParams, avgFGroupParams = avgPListParams)
```

### Formulae

Formulae can be automatically calculated for all features using the `generateFormulas()` function. The following algorithms are currently supported:

Algorithm    | Usage                                          | Remarks
------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------
[GenForm]    | `generateFormulas(algorithm = "genform", ...)` | Bundled with `patRoon`. Reasonable default.
[SIRIUS]     | `generateFormulas(algorithm = "sirius", ...)`  | Requires MS/MS data.
DataAnalysis | `generateFormulas(algorithm = "bruker", ...)`  | Requires FMF features (i.e. `findFeatures(algorithm = "bruker", ...)`). MS peak lists are not needed. Uses _SmartFormula_ algorithms.

Calculation with [GenForm] is often a good default. It is fast and basic rules can be applied to filter out obvious non-existing formulae. More thorough calculation is performed with [SIRIUS]: this algorithm often yields fewer and often more plausible results. However, [SIRIUS] requires MS/MS data (hence features without will not have results) and formula prediction may not work well for compounds that structurally deviate from the training sets used by [SIRIUS]. Calculation with DataAnalysis is only possible when features are obtained with DataAnalysis as well. An advantage is that analysis files do not have to be converted and no MS peak generation is necessary, however, compared to other algorithms calculation is often relative slow.

There are two methods for formula assignment:

1. Formulae are first calculated for each individual feature within a feature group. These results are then pooled, outliers are removed and remaining formulae are assigned to the feature group (i.e. `calculateFeatures = TRUE`).
2. Formulae are directly calculated for each feature group by using group averaged peak lists (see previous section) (i.e. `calculateFeatures = FALSE`).

The first method is more thorough and the possibility to remove outliers may sometimes result in better formula assignment. However, the second method is much faster and generally recommended for large number of analyses.

By default formulae are calculated using _only_ MS data and using _both_ MS and MS/MS data (duplicates are removed). An advantage of this approach is that formulae can still be assigned even when no MS/MS data is available. However, a disadvantage is that formulae needs to be calculated twice. The `MSMode` argument (listed below) can be used to customize this behaviour. Note that SIRIUS only works with MS/MS data, hence, the behaviour of this algorithm is fixed.

An overview of common parameters that are typically set to customize formula calculation is listed below.

<!-- UNDONE: link to adduct section -->

Argument          | Algorithm(s) | Remarks
----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
relMzDev          | `genform`, `sirius` | The maximum relative _m/z_ deviation for a formula to be considered (in _ppm_).
elements          | `genform`, `sirius` | Which elements to consider. By default `"CHNOP"`. Try to limit possible elements as much as possible.
calculateFeatures | `genform`, `sirius` | Whether formulae should be calculated first for all features (see discussion above) (always `TRUE` with DataAnalysis).
featThreshold     | All                 | Minimum relative amount (_0-1_) amongst all features within a feature group that a formula candidate should be present (e.g. _1_ means that a candidate is only considered if it was assigned to all features). 
adduct            | `genform`, `sirius` | The adduct to consider for calculation (e.g. `"[M+H]+"`, `"[M-H]-"`).
MSMode            | `genform`, `bruker` | Whether formulae should be generated only from MS data (`"ms"`), MS/MS data (`"msms"`) or both (`"both"`). The latter is default, see discussion above.
profile           | `sirius`            | Instrument profile, e.g. `"qtof"`, `"orbitrap"`, `"fticr"`.

Some typical examples:

```{r forms,eval=FALSE}
formulasGF <- generateFormulas(fGroups, "genform", mslists) # GenForm, default settings
formulasGF2 <- generateFormulas(fGroups, "genform", mslists, calculateFeatures = FALSE) # direct feature group assignment (faster)
formulasSIR <- generateFormulas(fGroups, "sirius", mslists, elements = "CHNOPSClBr") # SIRIUS, common elements for pollutant
formulasSIR2 <- generateFormulas(fGroups, "sirius", adduct = "[M-H]-") # SIRIUS, negative ionization
formulasBr <- generateFormulas(fGroups, "bruker", MSMode = "MSMS") # Only consider MSMS data (SmartFormula3D)
```
