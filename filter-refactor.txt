...

- move/copy rGroups to subset?
- add quantitative value for replicate filter? --> maxReplicateRSD
- new naming for filters:
    - absMinAnalyses / relMinAnalyses
    - absMinReplicates / relMinReplicates
    - absMinFeatures / relMinFeatures
    - absMinReplicateAbundance / relMinReplicateAbundance
    - 
    - absMinIntensity / relMinIntensity
    - preAbsMinIntensity / preRelMinIntensity
    - 
    - blankThreshold
    - removeBlanks
    - 
    - maxReplicateRSD
    - 
    - mzDefectRange


NOTES
- blank filter needs pre intensity for getting rid of too low blank signals, however, blank threshold might also take care of that
- replicate filter should be done before blank filter for better accuracy of blank removal
- replicate filter should be done again after intensities/abundances/blank removal in case any of the features within replicate are now removed.
- rGroups/removeRefAnalyses should be done after blank filter to avoid not being able to detect blank signals
    - what about between replicate filters? I guess before them
- repetitions can be removed(?)
    - not really since abundances can influence each other, but blank filter doesn't have to be repeated?
    - mention that repetitions now only covers abundance filters (and rename argument?)
    - or it's not needed afterall? replicate filter should be before other abundances, as they cannot affect replicate
- replicate #1 does only blanks?
