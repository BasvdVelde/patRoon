Release:
- Vignette
- Reference docs
    - Package docs
    - Examples?
- more withr wrapping? (dev, par)
- re-enable cleaning for GenForm compile
- windows
- file hashes for findFeaturesXCMS/EnviPick
- DA tests
- patRoon.path.metFragCL --> patRoon.path.MetFragCL
- clarify that sirius headless 4.0 now also works
- do something with sirius fingerprints?
- fillPeaks for CAMERA (and RAMClustR?)
- mzR precursor window in newProject()
- filter method for components (e.g. isotopes, adducts)
- mass defect components
- fix compoundViewer
- check why generics sometimes are not found
- remove R xml code for OpenMS features/feature groups
- remove R intensity loading code for OpenMS features
- remove XCMS EIC loading (and update checkChromatograms())
- add more options to reportPlots argument of reportMD()?
- importFeatures() function (analog to importFeatureGroups)
- getXcmsSet --> export
- generateCompounds: take averaged mass spectrum (as an option)
- support fastcluster for compounds clustering/int component clusters?
- groupFeaturesScreening functionality for features?
- reportPDF/reportMD: MS only formulas are not reported?
- integrate OpenMS feature scoring and isotopes and PPS in general (also include filters?)
- update tutorial on website
- feature optim:
    - docs
        - mention parameters default unless specified
    - qualitative optim?
    - keep retcor_done?
    - get rid of getXCMSSet() calls?
    - cache?
- progressbar and parallel enviPick
- OpenMS: also write XMLs in C++? Support newest grouper?
- clearCache: partial match
- MSPeakLists
    - isotope tagging is lost after averaging
    - most intense analysis as alternative to averaging?
    - report spectra/tables?
    - don't subset on analyses? or re-average? if no, mention in docs
    - $ method?
- algorithm slot/method for all classes
- MetFrag: (buggy) trivial name fetching not needed anymore?
- reportMD: if blanks are still present chord etc not plotted?
- removeRefAnalyses TRUE by default?
- convertMSFiles() add DA functionality
- SIRIUS compounds: report charged formula for fragInfo (as is now done for formulas, also affects formula scoring for compounds)
- formulas
    - DBE calculation for SIRIUS?
    - set column order?
    - DA: also include precursor in fragments?
    - mSigma --> isoScore? (tricky as low value is best) If yes, mention in docs...
    - customize/document ranking column order? (only do rank for sirius?)
    - how to handle ranking of consensus results?
        - rank by one normalized column per algo? (GenForm: either MS_match or comb_match)
        - or simply don't and mention limitation in doc? (one limitation: filtering)
    - test DA formulas, ranking (mSigma)
    - OM reporting
- plotSpec(): mark precursor?
- look into supervisors for processx
- groupTable --> makeTable
- filter() for compounds: copy new functionality from formulas method
- harmonize adduct specification for formulas/compounds (also update calculateIonFormula())
- suspect screening: add MS/MS qualifiers
- DA
    - better checks what data is present in DA?
    - test MS peak lists deisotoping?
    - setDAMethod(): mention that files are closed prior the method application, option to save or not
    - mention that highest intensity mz is assumed to be feature
    - auto close/save files
    - make Cmpnt column optional for DA peaklists
    - merge generateDACompounds()
- document pwiz path option
