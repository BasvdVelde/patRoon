Release:
- Vignette
- Reference docs
    - Package docs
    - Examples?
- more withr wrapping? (dev, par)
- re-enable cleaning for GenForm compile
- windows
- file hashes for findFeaturesXCMS/EnviPick
- DA tests
- patRoon.path.metFragCL --> patRoon.path.MetFragCL
- clarify that sirius headless 4.0 now also works
- do something with sirius fingerprints?
- fillPeaks for CAMERA (and RAMClustR?)
- mzR precursor window in newProject()
- filter method for components (e.g. isotopes, adducts)
- mass defect components
- fix compoundViewer
- check why generics sometimes are not found
- remove R xml code for OpenMS features/feature groups
- remove R intensity loading code for OpenMS features
- remove XCMS EIC loading (and update checkChromatograms())
- add more options to reportPlots argument of reportMD()?
- importFeatures() function (analog to importFeatureGroups)
- getXcmsSet --> export
- generateCompounds: take averaged mass spectrum (as an option)
- support fastcluster for compounds clustering/int component clusters?
- groupFeaturesScreening functionality for features?
- reportPDF/reportMD: MS only formulas are not reported?
- integrate OpenMS feature scoring and isotopes and PPS in general (also include filters?)
- update tutorial on website
- feature optim:
    - docs
        - mention parameters default unless specified
    - qualitative optim?
    - keep retcor_done?
    - get rid of getXCMSSet() calls?
    - cache?
- progressbar and parallel enviPick
- OpenMS: also write XMLs in C++?
- clearCache: partial match
- MSPeakLists
    - isotope tagging is lost after averaging
    - most intense analysis as alternative to averaging?
    - report spectra/tables?
    - don't subset on analyses? or re-average? if no, mention in docs
    - $ method?
- algorithm slot/method for all classes
- MetFrag: (buggy) trivial name fetching not needed anymore?
- reportMD: if blanks are still present chord etc not plotted?
- removeRefAnalyses TRUE by default?
- SIRIUS compounds: report charged formula for fragInfo (as is now done for formulas, also affects formula scoring for compounds)
- formulas
    - keep ana_min_intensity etc?
    - DBE calculation for SIRIUS?
    - set column order?
    - genform(/DA?): also include precursor in fragments? or omit from SIRIUS?
    - set mergedBy in getFragmentInfoFromForms()?
    - byMSMS filter
    - more options to makeTable? (element ratios? see Olaf's work)
    - docs
        - move generics in to right place, set aliases
        - featureFormulas() name?
        - clarify feature & group formulas
    - tests
        - $ method
        - calculateFeatures TRUE/FALSE
        - verify group count for consensus
