general
- more withr wrapping? (dev, par)
- windows
- fillPeaks for CAMERA (and RAMClustR?)
- remove XCMS EIC loading (and update checkChromatograms())
- support fastcluster for compounds clustering/int component clusters?
- data.table: add '[]' at the end of (exported) functions when ':=' was used (print bug workaround)
- setAs() for as.data.table()/as.data.frame() methods
- negate for all filter methods
- make algorithm names more consistent
- convertMSFiles(): add DA functionality
- suspect screening: add MS/MS qualifiers
- DA
    - generateMSPeakListsDA: find precursor masses with larger window
    - tests
        - utils? EICs with export/vdiffr?
        - test MS peak lists deisotoping?
- somehow integrate convertMSFiles() in newProject()? And other file types?

docs
- More vignettes
- Reference docs
    - Examples?
- update tutorial


features
- file hashes for findFeaturesXCMS/EnviPick
- importFeatures() function (analog to importFeatureGroups)
- getXcmsSet --> export
- groupFeaturesScreening functionality for features?
- integrate OpenMS feature scoring and isotopes and PPS in general (also include filters?)
- feature optim:
    - docs
        - mention parameters default unless specified
    - qualitative optim?
    - keep retcor_done?
    - get rid of getXCMSSet() calls?
    - cache?
- progressbar and parallel enviPick
- OpenMS: Support newest grouper?
- removeRefAnalyses TRUE by default (or if blank filter is specified?)?
- plotChord: which argument


MSPeakLists
- isotope tagging is lost after averaging
- most intense analysis as alternative to averaging?
- report spectra/tables?
- collapse averagedPeakLists
- test avg params
- add pruneMissingPrecursorMS to filter()?


compounds
- patRoon.path.metFragCL --> patRoon.path.MetFragCL
- clarify that sirius headless 4.0 now also works
- do something with sirius fingerprints?
- fix compoundViewer
- MetFrag: (buggy) trivial name fetching not needed anymore?
- convert score csv to internal data?
- SIRIUS: use --auto-charge instead of manually fixing charge of fragments (or not? conflicting docs on what it does)


formulas
- DBE calculation for SIRIUS?
- set column order?
- customize/document ranking column order? (only do rank for sirius?)
- how to handle ranking of consensus results?
    - rank by one normalized column per algo? (GenForm: either MS_match or comb_match)
    - or simply don't and mention limitation in doc? (one limitation: filtering)
- OM reporting
- as.data.table: option to average per replicate group?
- note/warning on GF slowness with high masses


components
- mass defect components


reporting
- add more options to reportPlots argument of reportMD()?
- reportPDF/reportMD: MS only formulas are not reported?
