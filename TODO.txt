Release:
- Vignette
- Reference docs
    - Package docs
    - Examples?
- more withr wrapping? (dev, par)
- re-enable cleaning for GenForm compile
- windows
- file hashes for findFeaturesXCMS/EnviPick
- DA tests
- patRoon.path.metFragCL --> patRoon.path.MetFragCL
- clarify that sirius headless 4.0 now also works
- do something with sirius fingerprints?
- fillPeaks for CAMERA (and RAMClustR?)
- mzR precursor window in newProject()
- filter method for components (e.g. isotopes, adducts)
- mass defect components
- fix compoundViewer
- check why generics sometimes are not found
- remove R xml code for OpenMS features/feature groups
- remove R intensity loading code for OpenMS features
- remove XCMS EIC loading (and update checkChromatograms())
- add more options to reportPlots argument of reportMD()?
- importFeatures() function (analog to importFeatureGroups)
- getXcmsSet --> export
- generateCompounds: take averaged mass spectrum (as an option)
- support fastcluster for compounds clustering/int component clusters?
- groupFeaturesScreening functionality for features?
- reportPDF/reportMD: MS only formulas are not reported?
- integrate OpenMS feature scoring and isotopes and PPS in general (also include filters?)
- update tutorial on website
- feature optim:
    - docs
        - mention parameters default unless specified
    - qualitative optim?
    - keep retcor_done?
    - get rid of getXCMSSet() calls?
    - cache?
- progressbar and parallel enviPick
- OpenMS: also write XMLs in C++?
- clearCache: partial match
- MSPeakLists
    - isotope tagging is lost after averaging
    - most intense analysis as alternative to averaging?
    - report spectra/tables?
    - don't subset on analyses? or re-average? if no, mention in docs
    - $ method?
- algorithm slot/method for all classes
- MetFrag: (buggy) trivial name fetching not needed anymore?
- reportMD: if blanks are still present chord etc not plotted?
- removeRefAnalyses TRUE by default?
- SIRIUS compounds: report charged formula for fragInfo (as is now done for formulas, also affects formula scoring for compounds)
- formulas
    - keep ana_min_intensity etc?
    - DBE calculation for SIRIUS?
    - set column order?
    - DA: also include precursor in fragments?
    - set mergedBy in getFragmentInfoFromForms()?
    - mSigma --> isoScore? (tricky as low value is best) If yes, mention in docs...
    - only some adducts are supported now (do more?)
    - only keep best scoring candidates for consensus? (what about fragments?? --> seems fine for genform/sirius as all scores are the same for each fragment, need to check DA)
    - customize/document ranking column order? (only do rank for sirius?)
    - how to handle ranking of consensus results?
      - rank by one normalized column per algo? (GenForm: either MS_match or comb_match)
      - or simply don't and mention limitation in doc? (one limitation: filtering)
    - docs / NEWS
        - move generics in to right place, set aliases
        - featureFormulas() name?
        - clarify feature & group formulas
        - countFragElements takes ionic formula (or remove option?)
        - OM refs
        - MS only formulas removed if MS/MS also present
        - filter() and makeTable()
        - unification of scorings: mention original names, value ranges (best/worst), table
        - GF now includes precursors in MS/MS annotation
        - formulaScorings()
        - scoreLimits filter: use -Inf/Inf for no min/max
        - detail consensus process
            - highest scoring candidate of analyses is retained(?)
            - feature consensus now uses both MS and MS/MS formulas for coverage calculation
    - tests
        - $ method
        - calculateFeatures TRUE/FALSE
        - verify group count for consensus
        - makeTable: check elements?
    - test DA formulas, ranking (mSigma)
- plotSpec(): mark precursor?
- look into supervisors for processx
- groupTable --> makeTable
