Release:
- Vignette
- Reference docs
    - Examples?
- more withr wrapping? (dev, par)
- windows
- file hashes for findFeaturesXCMS/EnviPick
- patRoon.path.metFragCL --> patRoon.path.MetFragCL
- clarify that sirius headless 4.0 now also works
- do something with sirius fingerprints?
- fillPeaks for CAMERA (and RAMClustR?)
- mzR precursor window in newProject()
- filter method for components (e.g. isotopes, adducts)
- mass defect components
- fix compoundViewer
- check why generics sometimes are not found
- remove XCMS EIC loading (and update checkChromatograms())
- add more options to reportPlots argument of reportMD()?
- importFeatures() function (analog to importFeatureGroups)
- getXcmsSet --> export
- support fastcluster for compounds clustering/int component clusters?
- groupFeaturesScreening functionality for features?
- reportPDF/reportMD: MS only formulas are not reported?
- integrate OpenMS feature scoring and isotopes and PPS in general (also include filters?)
- update tutorial on website
- feature optim:
    - docs
        - mention parameters default unless specified
    - qualitative optim?
    - keep retcor_done?
    - get rid of getXCMSSet() calls?
    - cache?
- progressbar and parallel enviPick
- OpenMS: Support newest grouper?
- MSPeakLists
    - isotope tagging is lost after averaging
    - most intense analysis as alternative to averaging?
    - report spectra/tables?
    - don't subset on analyses? or re-average? if no, mention in docs
    - $ method?
    - collapse averagedPeakLists
    - test avg params
- MetFrag: (buggy) trivial name fetching not needed anymore?
- reportMD: if blanks are still present chord etc not plotted?
- removeRefAnalyses TRUE by default (or if blank filter is specified?)?
- convertMSFiles(): add DA functionality
- formulas
    - DBE calculation for SIRIUS?
    - set column order?
    - customize/document ranking column order? (only do rank for sirius?)
    - how to handle ranking of consensus results?
        - rank by one normalized column per algo? (GenForm: either MS_match or comb_match)
        - or simply don't and mention limitation in doc? (one limitation: filtering)
    - OM reporting
    - as.data.table: option to average per replicate group?
    - note/warning on GF slowness with high masses
- harmonize adduct specification for formulas/compounds (also update calculateIonFormula())
    - if done: add loss filter to compounds
    - if done: fix MSMode="msms" for DA formulas (so that adduct can specified for neutral formula calculation)
- suspect screening: add MS/MS qualifiers
- DA
    - generateMSPeakListsDA: find precursor masses with larger window
    - tests
        - utils? EICs with export/vdiffr?
        - test MS peak lists deisotoping?
- data.table: add '[]' at the end of (exported) functions when ':=' was used (print bug workaround)
- setAs() for as.data.table()/as.data.frame() methods
- compounds
    - convert score csv to internal data?
- SIRIUS: use --auto-charge instead of manually fixing charge of fragments (or not? conflicting docs on what it does)
